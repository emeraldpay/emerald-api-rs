= Emerald API for Rust

== Crate Features

Crate is split into different categogies representing different Emerald API services.
In addition to that, each service can have a Client code, and Server code. Both share the same Protobuf.

To use a particular service client, ex. for a Market API use `market-client` feature. Or `market-server` if you need the server stubs.

.Categories (aka Services) are:
- `auth` - Auth API (enabled by default if any `*-client` feature is enabled)
- `blockchain` - Blockchain API
- `market` - Market API
- `monitoring` - Monitoring API
- `transaction` - Transaction API
